# Progress Tracker

## What Works

- The code for generating example "BEFORE" and "AFTER" images has been successfully removed from `main.py`.

## What's Left to Build / Fix

- **Verify `run.bat` Behavior:** Confirm that running `run.bat` no longer generates the "BEFORE" and "AFTER" example images.
- **Address Startup Errors (if necessary):** If the application still doesn't run correctly via `run.bat`, revisit the previous plan to test disabling the Streamlit file watcher (`streamlit run main.py --server.fileWatcherType none`) to verify if this resolves the startup errors.
- **Verify Core Functionality:** If the app runs, test core features (image upload, generate design) to ensure core features work.
- **Define and Implement Core Features:** (Future work).

## Current Status

- **Example Image Generation Removed:** The `generate_example_images()` function and associated display code have been successfully removed from `main.py`.
- **Startup Error Status:** The previous attempt to fix startup errors with lazy imports failed. The next step documented was to test disabling the Streamlit file watcher. This step is still relevant if `run.bat` is not successfully launching the application.

## Known Issues

- **Persistent (Potentially):** `RuntimeError: no running event loop` and `RuntimeError: Tried to instantiate class '__path__._path'` during startup, caused by Streamlit's file watcher interacting with `torch.classes`. (Status: Pending verification with `run.bat` and potential workaround testing).

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Lazy Imports:** Attempted lazy imports for heavy AI libraries. **(Failed)**
- **Disable File Watcher:** Adopted strategy to disable Streamlit's file watcher as a workaround for the persistent startup error (pending test).
- **Removed Example Image Generation:** Decided to remove the example "BEFORE" and "AFTER" image generation functionality as it was not required by the user.
