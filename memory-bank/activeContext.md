# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Resolving the `RuntimeError: no running event loop` and `RuntimeError: Tried to instantiate class '__path__._path'` errors that occur when running the Streamlit application.

## Recent Changes

- Initialized all core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- Analyzed `requirements.txt` (no pinned versions).
- Analyzed `main.py` and identified global imports of heavy AI libraries as the likely cause of the error.
- Modified `main.py` to use lazy imports for `torch`, `transformers`, and `diffusers`. **(Attempt Failed - Same error occurred)**.

## Next Steps

1.  **Test Disabling File Watcher:** Run the Streamlit application with the file watcher disabled (`streamlit run main.py --server.fileWatcherType none`) to verify if this resolves the startup errors.
2.  **Update Memory Bank:** Document the outcome of this test in `progress.md` and potentially other files.
3.  **Verify Functionality:** If the app runs, perform basic tests (upload image, generate design) to ensure core features work. Note the limitation of needing manual restarts for code changes.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- The **lazy import pattern** was **not sufficient** to resolve the conflict between Streamlit's file watcher and `torch.classes`.
- **New Strategy:** Disable Streamlit's file watcher using the `--server.fileWatcherType none` flag as a workaround. This will disable hot-reloading for code changes.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Lazy Imports:** (Ineffective for this specific `torch.classes` issue with Streamlit watcher).
- **Disabling File Watcher:** When encountering persistent startup errors due to conflicts between Streamlit's file watcher and complex library internals (like `torch.classes`), disabling the watcher (`--server.fileWatcherType none`) is a viable workaround, accepting the trade-off of losing automatic code reloading.

## Learnings & Insights

- The conflict between Streamlit's file watcher and `torch.classes` is persistent and not resolved by simple lazy imports. It likely stems from a deeper interaction during module inspection that happens regardless of import timing.
- Disabling the file watcher is a necessary step in such cases to allow the application to start.
