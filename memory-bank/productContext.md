# Product Context

## Problem Solved

- Provides a user interface (via Streamlit) for interacting with or visualizing results from a PyTorch-based process or model. (Inferred)

## How it Should Work

- Users should be able to launch the Streamlit application.
- The application should successfully load and utilize PyTorch components without runtime errors.
- (Further details on specific user interactions are TBD).

## User Experience Goals

- A stable and responsive application.
- Clear presentation of PyTorch-related outputs or interactions.

*This context is based on initial inferences and will be updated as the project develops.*
