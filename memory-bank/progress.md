# Progress Tracker

## What Works

- (Unknown - Previous fix attempt failed).

## What's Left to Build / Fix

- **Verify Workaround:** Confirm that disabling the file watcher (`--server.fileWatcherType none`) allows the application to start without errors.
- **Verify Basic Functionality:** If the app starts, test core features (image upload, analysis, generation).
- **Define and Implement Core Features:** (Future work).

## Current Status

- **Fix Attempt Failed:** Modifying `main.py` to use lazy imports did **not** resolve the startup errors. The same `torch.classes` related error occurred.
- **Next Action:** Run `streamlit run main.py --server.fileWatcherType none` to test if disabling the file watcher allows the application to start.

## Known Issues

- **Persistent:** `RuntimeError: no running event loop` and `RuntimeError: Tried to instantiate class '__path__._path'` during startup, caused by Streamlit's file watcher interacting with `torch.classes`. (Status: Attempting Workaround).

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Lazy Imports:** Attempted lazy imports for heavy AI libraries. **(Failed)**
- **Disable File Watcher:** Adopted strategy to disable Streamlit's file watcher as a workaround for the persistent startup error.
