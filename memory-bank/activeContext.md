# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Removed the generation of example "BEFORE" and "AFTER" images from `main.py`.
- The previous focus on resolving startup errors (`RuntimeError: no running event loop`, `RuntimeError: Tried to instantiate class '__path__._path'`) is still relevant if the application is not yet running correctly via `run.bat`.

## Recent Changes

- Initialized all core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- Analyzed `requirements.txt` (no pinned versions).
- Analyzed `main.py` and identified global imports of heavy AI libraries as the likely cause of the error.
- Modified `main.py` to use lazy imports for `torch`, `transformers`, and `diffusers`. **(Attempt Failed - Same error occurred)**.
- Removed the `generate_example_images()` function and the code displaying the example gallery from `main.py` as requested by the user.

## Next Steps

1.  **Verify `run.bat` Behavior:** Confirm that running `run.bat` no longer generates the "BEFORE" and "AFTER" example images.
2.  **Address Startup Errors (if necessary):** If the application still doesn't run correctly via `run.bat`, revisit the previous plan to test disabling the Streamlit file watcher (`streamlit run main.py --server.fileWatcherType none`) to verify if this resolves the startup errors.
3.  **Update Memory Bank:** Document the outcome of verifying `run.bat` and any further troubleshooting steps in `progress.md` and potentially other files.
4.  **Verify Core Functionality:** If the app runs, perform basic tests (upload image, generate design) to ensure core features work.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- The **lazy import pattern** was **not sufficient** to resolve the conflict between Streamlit's file watcher and `torch.classes`.
- **Disabling File Watcher:** When encountering persistent startup errors due to conflicts between Streamlit's file watcher and complex library internals (like `torch.classes`), disabling the watcher (`--server.fileWatcherType none`) is a viable workaround, accepting the trade-off of losing automatic code reloading.
- **Removed Example Image Generation:** The code for generating example "BEFORE" and "AFTER" images has been removed from `main.py` as per user request.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Lazy Imports:** (Ineffective for this specific `torch.classes` issue with Streamlit watcher).
- **Disabling File Watcher:** When encountering persistent startup errors due to conflicts between Streamlit's file watcher and complex library internals (like `torch.classes`), disabling the watcher (`--server.fileWatcherType none`) is a viable workaround, accepting the trade-off of losing automatic code reloading.
- **Removed Unnecessary Functionality:** Code for generating example images has been removed to streamline the application based on user needs.

## Learnings & Insights

- The conflict between Streamlit's file watcher and `torch.classes` is persistent and not resolved by simple lazy imports. It likely stems from a deeper interaction during module inspection that happens regardless of import timing.
- Disabling the file watcher is a necessary step in such cases to allow the application to start.
- The example image generation was a separate feature from the core design generation and could be safely removed.
