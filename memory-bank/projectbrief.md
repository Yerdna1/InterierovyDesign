# Project Brief

## Core Goal

Develop a Streamlit application that integrates with PyTorch.

## Initial Requirements (Inferred)

- Use Streamlit for the user interface.
- Use PyTorch for underlying computations or model loading/inference.
- The application should run without the errors currently observed (`RuntimeError: no running event loop` and `RuntimeError: Tried to instantiate class '__path__._path'`).

## Scope

- Resolve the immediate runtime errors preventing the application from starting correctly.
- Ensure basic functionality of the Streamlit/PyTorch integration (details TBD).

*This brief is based on initial observations and error messages. It will be refined as more context is gathered.*
